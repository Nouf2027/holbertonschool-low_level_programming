This project is about understanding how singly linked lists work in C.
A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (called a node) contains data and a pointer to the next node.
In this project, I learned how to build, traverse, add, and free nodes in a singly linked list, and how it differs from arrays in memory management and flexibility.
